Is it really nessesary to have a whitelist on that server? All of the merchants are required to have all payment information encrypted on-site securely- there's nothing a hacker would be able to steal.

Seriously, this whitelist auth is more trouble than it's worth- it'd be really nice if someone could just take it down.
