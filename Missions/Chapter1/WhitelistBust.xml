According to reports from various merchants, 
there's a whitelist on the Merchant Hub Server 
that is preventing them from logging
in to the merchant network.

As it turns out, we also need access to 
the Merchant Network- not for anything
truly nefarious as it were, but because 
it links to several other nodes we'd benefit
from having access to. 

The whitelist is our last obstacle, and 
I've managed to write in
a backdoor to the whitelist server.

All you need to do is delete the
Authenticator.dll file from the Whitelist
directory file on the linked computer. 
That'll let us in, and also 
let everyone else in, too. 
Helping the merchants out should also 
give us a good boost to our reputation.

Regardless, be sure not to leave logs 
on this mission. We're technically
not supposed to remove the file, 
but the tech support they have is apparently
incapable of removing the whitelist.

Also, here's a link and your login to our asset dropserver. 
As we get more tools,you'll find them there. 
Keep this in mind.

Good luck.
