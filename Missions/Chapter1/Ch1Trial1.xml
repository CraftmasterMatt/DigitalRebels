<body>I don't know you, and frankly I'm going to keep this short.

Firstly I have no idea who you are or how you managed
to attract my attention, but you have it now. 

Apparently you're some kind of hacker, which is good- 
right now I need all the help I can get. 

Chances are high that you're pretty bored.

If you can prove your worth to me as a hacker, 
I will make it worth your while. 
But you'd better not waste my time.

This is basic stuff, so you shouldn't have any problems.
If you do, though... well, the last one
you'll hear it from is me.

I've linked your instructions below.
Take care of it.
