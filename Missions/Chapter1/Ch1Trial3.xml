		<body>Excellent work.
I'm pretty certain I can invite you to my group's IRC
now- where we do projects and stuff. You've earned my trust,
albeit semi-reluctantly. I'm going to keep an eye on you,
so don't try anything funny. 

I've linked to our IRC Channel below. I'll get you a link
to our Asset and Drop server soon, too.

Thanks for your help.
