    <body>
	A group of script squids known as the 
	NoscoperZ are currently in the process 
	of a Distributed Denial of Service attack 
	on a private livestream event. 
	
	The program they're using, MegaFlare FFX10, 
	is a powerful and yet easy to use program 
	for such a purpose.
	
	You'll need to gain access to all three 
	of their battlestations, and then delete both 
	MegaFlare and the settings in the /megaflare directory.
	Make sure you wipe the entire folder.
	
	Don't bother saving a copy of MegaFlare-FFX10, 
	either- we already have a copy of it 
	for testing purposes ONLY.
	(In other words, don't ask for a copy.)
	
	As usual, don't forget to clear your logs. 
	They're script squids, yes, but it never hurts 
	to be too careful.
	
	Good Luck.
	-Zaz.
