<body>Oh my gods, finally.

Do you even /know/ how aggravating it was to have
your battlestation chirping at you like a mindless
bird or something? FINALLY IT'S OVER.

Apparently the company uses the WebOroboros
worm program to break into their targets and inject
an adbot through the opened port. While I don't
normally condone wrecking systems, these guys
deserved it.

Anyways, hold onto WebOroboros, it'll come
in handy to you as a hacker. I'm relieved-
SOMEONE was able to stop the adbot,
but I'm still keeping my guard up until
I can find a patch to keep out WebOroboros.

Anyways- next mission.

I need you to retrieve a password from one of my backup computers.
I would do it myself, but it's a tablet, and I can't seem to locate
it right now. It's probably plugged in, so you should still be able to
access it- I'm still busy scrubbing the remnants of the adbot out of
my systems.

The password is CASE SENSITIVE. Please reply with it
as soon as you have it. It's for something very important.

I'm counting on you.
