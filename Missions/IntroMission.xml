<body>Hello #PLAYERNAME#!

I got your new backup server up and running. 
It is secondhand, though, and the previous owner had 
a few requests for the next owner (AKA you.)

Firstly they want the new owner to delete a text file called
"DeleteThis.txt" in the home folder.
They also want you to download whatever program 
is in the /bin directory, and run it- 
whenever you're not busy.

Also, I'm sorry in advance, but I forgot the password. 
I'll email you it as soon as I can. I wrote down the old password 
but I just changed it for security.
You might actually need to break in, again, I'm sorry.

Thanks for the money!
