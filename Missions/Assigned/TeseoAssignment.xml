Hello! If you're reading this message, somehow I haven't programmed something right
in Digital Rebels. Please PM me on Discord under CraftmasterMatt #6334.

You WILL break the game if you accept this mission- you can not abandon missions,
and this mission is impossible to complete.

Thanks again!
