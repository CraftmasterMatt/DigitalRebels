		<body>Hello #PLAYERNAME#!

I'm really sorry I forgot your password earlier!
I linked it down below. All sales are final- I'm no tech support.
You're probably better with computers than I am. 
	
You'd better not do illegal stuff with that backup server,
even though I can't stop you if you /do/ want to do that sort of stuff.
	
Just do me a favor and don't get caught, mostly because
I'd rather not be an accomplice to whatever you do
just because you bought a backup server from me.

Reply back with whatever the name of the program that was in the 
bin folder was as soon as you get this email, okay? 
	
Thanks (again) for the money!
